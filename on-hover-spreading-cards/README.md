This was made as a practice following the video [ImNotGoodEnough.js](https://youtu.be/6TYkDy54q4E).

## To run:
In order to have this "hot-reload" functionality, I imported [Live.js](https://livejs.com/) as a script on the HTML file. But I managed it to work only using python3 to create a server.
The command is: `python3 -m http.server` and the site will be available on [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) by default.

But if you're not changing any code, you can simply open the index.html file.
